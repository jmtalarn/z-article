He became a dressmaker, and in 1937 received a patent for what he called \u201ca new, original, and ornamental design for a Dress Ensemble.\u201d While my grandfather has been gone for many years, I recently asked my uncle about the patent. He claimed that the actress Elizabeth Taylor once wore the dress it describes in a photo shoot for <i>Seventeen<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, my grandfather was an innovator. He launched his own business, and thrived in the teeth of the Great Depression. But beyond our family, his impact was modest. His business closed when he retired. It never achieved scale or left a mark on our culture.<\/p>\n<p>This personal story underscores just how difficult it is\u2014and how rare\u2014for even a successful business to break through. Which is part of what makes putting together our annual 50 Most Innovative Companies list such a challenge. Our reporting team sifts through thousands of enterprises each year, searching for those that tap both heartstrings and purse strings and use the engine of commerce to make a difference in the world. Impact is among our key criteria.<\/p>\n<p>This year marks the 10th edition of our Most Innovative Companies ranking. Looking back on that history, there are plenty of eye-opening lessons (see my article \u201cTen Innovation Lessons of the Past 10 Years\u201d on <a href=\"http:\/\/FASTCOMPANY.COM\" target=\"_self\">fastcompany.com<\/a>). This year\u2019s list offers a brand-new slate of forward-looking ideas, from Amazon to Snap, Open Whisper Systems to Orbital Insight. My grandfather would be amazed by the radical, fast-paced changes of these companies. Here are 10 observations about the current state of the innovation economy.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0018-027\/39975-1-eng-US\/f0018-022.jpg\" width=\"295\" height=\"116\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0018-02\" title=\"f0018-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p class=\"byline\"><b>Robert Safian <a href=\"mailto:editor@fastcompany.com\" target=\"_self\">editor@fastcompany.com<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. YOU CAN\u2019T PATENT INNOVATION.<\/b><\/h3><p>Amazon and its chief, Jeff Bezos, have been defying expectations for more than two decades. The question is: How? Executive editor Noah Robischon sat down with Bezos, and what he learned (page 26) points not to data metrics and rigorous processes\u2014 which Amazon deeply relies on\u2014but rather to a willingness to embrace uncertainty, experimentation, and messy inconsistencies. Not everything in the Amazon world is orchestrated for perfection. Bezos doesn\u2019t just tolerate this; he enjoys it. What he understands is that each critical new idea may arise in a different way, from a different source.<\/p>\n<h3><b>2. YOUTH WILL BE SERVED.<\/b><\/h3><p>When <i>Fast Company<\/i>\u2019s first Most Innovative Companies list came out, Snapchat didn\u2019t exist. Neither did Airbnb or Uber, Slack or Spotify. The rise of these businesses illuminates the risks that established industries face, and how tastes in modern culture are shifting faster than ever. Younger consumers expect newer, better products all the time. That reality can\u2019t be ignored. And what starts out serving the youth will soon serve us all. As senior writer Mark Wilson notes in his terrific assessment of Snap (page 34), \u201cThe only people who underestimate Snap are those who don\u2019t take the time to see what\u2019s right in front of their face.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><b>3. CHINA IS FOR REAL.<\/b><\/h3><p>Six of the companies on this year\u2019s list are Chinese\u2014more than we\u2019ve ever had before. This was not a strategic objective of ours but a natural result of our bottom-up reporting. The days of dismissing Chinese businesses as mere copycats are long gone. As senior writer Austin Carr reports (page 46), an innovation ecosystem has taken hold in China that is arguably more competitive than Silicon Valley. Outfits like Alibaba and Tencent are so forward-focused, even the best U.S.-based businesses have to take note and\u2014with increasing frequency\u2014they find themselves playing catch-up. As one source tells Carr regarding the apps Alipay and WeChat, \u201cThere is no comparison with anything in the U.S. Maybe Facebook eventually gets there\u2014maybe.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><b>4. THE \u2018\u2018UNDENIABLES\u2019\u2019 ARE BACK.<\/b><\/h3><p>Historically, only a half dozen or so of our 50 Most Innovative Companies are repeats from the prior year. This time, 12 are returnees. That\u2019s because these enterprises continue to set the pace for their industries, showing agility and aggressiveness that makes them undeniable. Netflix (page 42) opened up its platform to the majority of the world, and followed that up by adding offline viewing, a devilishly complex legal and business maneuver. Uber (page 33) pulled a Uturn in its China business, only to double down on self-driving cars. Airbnb (page 50) moved into bookings and is exploring ticket sales, and BuzzFeed (page 50) took the germ of an idea, Tasty, and built a huge success. Google (page 32) is disrupting photo storage, and Apple (page 33) is delving deeper into chip making. Whatever distractions other businesses may face, these leaders seem impervious. They are setting their own course, and everyone else is being forced to follow.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0019-01\/39968-1-eng-US\/f0019-012.jpg\" width=\"335\" height=\"471\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-01\" title=\"f0019-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by Cru Camara<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0019-02\/39961-1-eng-US\/f0019-022.jpg\" width=\"336\" height=\"471\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-02\" title=\"f0019-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nRamona Rosales<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0019-03\/39954-1-eng-US\/f0019-032.jpg\" width=\"335\" height=\"476\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-03\" title=\"f0019-03\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nEric T.

WATCH OUT FOR THAT CLUSTER!<\/b><\/h3><p>Some changes are felt before they are seen, an underground tremor that puts us just a bit off balance. That often happens when a group of small yet creative players are deftly disrupting the same area. Beginning on page 56, we highlight a quintet of companies\u2014Glossier, Kenzo, Clique Media Group, Hypebeast<i>,<\/i> and RewardStyle\u2014that use content as the engine for commerce. Elsewhere, we highlight Beyond Meat (page 89) and Chobani (page 44), two examples of health-driven disruptions in the food business. One Medical (page 74), Medtronic (page 82), Celmatix (page 88), and Headspace (page 85) point to a wave of coming techcentered changes in the medical field, regardless of what policy makers do in D.C.<\/p>\n<h3><b>6. LITTLE ENGINES CAN BLOW YOUR MIND.<\/b><\/h3><p>Some tech observers critique the way investment dollars are disproportionately allocated to startups aimed at rich, coastal, urban elites\u2014and there\u2019s certainly some basis for that concern. But there are also plenty of groundbreaking operations in other arenas. Farmers Business Network (page 74), for instance, is pooling data and buying power for individual farmers to help them better compete with agribusiness. Simplify Networks (page 89) is a Malaysian outfit applying sharing-economy ideas to mobile-phone data plans in the developing world: Why shouldn\u2019t people be able to sell bandwidth, that they\u2019ve paid for but haven\u2019t used, to others? And then there\u2019s Orbital (page 72), which analyzes satellite imagery to \u201cunderstand what we\u2019re doing on the earth and to the earth,\u201d as founder James Crawford puts it. While Orbital\u2019s revenue largely derives from financial firms, it\u2019s partnered with the World Resources Institute to help with detecting and stopping deforestation.<\/p>\n<h3><b>7. INNOVATION HAS AS OUL.<\/b><\/h3><p>Not every new venture is about making money. Some are about giving it away. Pledge 1% (page 84) is targeting startups with a novel message: Along with setting aside a percentage of your business\u2019s profits for employees and investors, why not take a portion and give it to a cause? Another tactic is at the heart of GoFundMe (page 66), a crowdsourced fundraising utility that has applied the model of Kickstarter and Indiegogo to personal giving\u2014and already generated $3 billion.<\/p>\n<h3><b>8. WHAT\u2019S MUNDANE CAN B E FABULOUS.<\/b><\/h3><p>Who cares about mattresses? As it turns out, a whole lot of people. In just a few years, Casper (page 76), which sees itself as the Nike of sleep, has built a $200-million-ayear operation on just four products. Thinx (page 80) is addressing a different need: menstrual leakage. CEO Miki Agrawal is attacking an unappreciated arena in our male-centric marketplace\u2014and making millions.<\/p>\n<h3><b>9. GUTS CAN LEAD TO GLORY.<\/b><\/h3><p>Many of the businesses and services that we love are powered by unseen forces that are essential to their success. Netflix, for instance, operates on the back of Amazon Web Services, a $13 billion business inside the e-commerce giant. Twilio (page 44) provides tools to app developers\u2014also including Netflix. IBM (page 54) has unleashed its Watson technology to bring AI capabilities to industries from professional sports to health care. MailChimp (page 89) helps myriad small businesses operate with more sophistication and efficiency. And then there\u2019s Open Whisper (page 51), whose security protocol not only underpins its own app but is helping Facebook provide its users with safer, more secure communications.<\/p>\n<h3><b>10. FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL.<\/b><\/h3><p>If there\u2019s a single thread that runs through this year\u2019s list, it\u2019s the importance of focus. Over the past year, the nation\u2019s political dialogue offered many reasons for uncertainty and pause. And yet the one sure recipe for obscurity in today\u2019s world is stasis. Culture will keep moving, and those enterprises that move with it\u2014that attack their missions with fearlessness\u2014 will find themselves in the strongest position to weather whatever political or economic disruption comes our way.<\/p>\n",

In its place is a highly curated version tailored for dense urban areas. \u201cHow do we keep our store experience relevant?\u201d asks Mark Schindele, Target\u2019s SVP of properties. \u201cWe customize, we evolve, and we understand our guests.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, Target will roll out 28 new flexible-format stores, double the number it opened in 2016. The company\u2019s first small-store effort, City Target, which launched in six locations in 2012, averaged about 100,000 square feet, still too big a footprint for major cities. The company faced a challenge: how to condense even more while providing customers with a total Target experience. Flex formats shrink the size to as little as 12,000 square feet and tailor merchandise to specific neighborhoods. They also dropped the special moniker: All Targets, regardless of the size or shape, would be known as Target.<\/p>\n<p>Manhattan got its first flex-format Target in October, in the Tribeca neighborhood, which has been flooded with stylish young families. The two-story outpost emphasizes apparel, toddler, and baby sections. (It\u2019s also the only Target so far to include a Chobani yogurt caf\u00e9 in place of the now-standard Starbucks.)<\/p>\n<p>Target, which once stood for consistency and endless choice, now wants to be adaptable, streamlined, and quick\u2014the company can research a new site and have doors open within a year. \u201cWe look at what needs aren\u2019t being met by a neighborhood,\u201d Schindele says. \u201cAnd then we meet them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>\u00d1Claire Dodson<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>MilesTones<\/b> Target recently hired former Walmart exec Shekar Natarajan to fill the new role of SVP of network planning and operational design.

But Moleskine knows that its future hinges on its ability to work in tandem with digital technology. A year ago, Moleskine released its Smart Writing Set, a pen and notebook that converts handwritten notes seamlessly from the page to an app. The company is now taking that idea a step further, leveraging its celebrated Timepage calendar app to work in conjunction with a new physical planner set to be released in 2017. Users can take a snapshot of the day\u2019s to-dos, which the software will recognize and integrate with Timepage. Eventually, the tech could operate like the Smart Writing Set. \u201cWe don\u2019t see analog and digital as antagonistic dimensions in the lives of real people,\u201d says CEO Arrigo Berni.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Moleskine continues to ramp up its physical pres- ence.

What does it look like? Is it manicured, with buildings set in a pattern so that everything flows together, designed for perfection? Or is it gritty and spontaneous, the kind of place where a restaurant might move into the space that used to house a dry cleaner? Boxes bearing the Amazon logo can arrive at doorsteps in either of these environments, of course, but Amazon\u2019s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, prefers the second type.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think neighborhoods, cities, and towns that have evolved are more interesting and delightful than ones that have been carefully top-down planned,\u201d he tells me when I meet him at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters in November. \u201cThere\u2019s just something very human\u201d about them, he says.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a surprising answer from a man known for his disciplined adherence to Six Sigma\u2013style processes and data-driven decision making. But it\u2019s also revealing. Over its nearly 22 years, Amazon has moved into one sector after another and gentrified it, even if that meant tearing down its own existing structures. Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker rose on the lot where its Fire Phone flamed out. The latest version of Amazon\u2019s streaming music service, Amazon Music Unlimited, was constructed on top of its initial music store, Amazon MP3, which opened nine years ago. Amazon Studios\u2019 Emmy Award\u2013winning original TV shows are built upon a crowdsourcing platform that the company first introduced in 2010 for aspiring scriptwriters. Even the company\u2019s fashion business\u2014Amazon is now the second-largest seller of apparel in the U.S., according to Morgan Stanley\u2014evolved from brand experiments in outdoor furniture (2004), home goods (2008), electronic accessories (2009), diapers (2014), and now perishables such as organic, fair-trade-certified coffee.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Apple, Google, and Microsoft, Amazon is not fixated on a tightly designed ecosystem of interlocking apps and services. Bezos instead emphasizes platforms that each serves its own customers in the best and fastest possible way. \u201cOur customers are loyal to us right up until the second somebody offers them a better service,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I love that. It\u2019s super-motivating for us.\u201d That impulse has spawned an awesome stream of creative firsts. Just this past year, Prime Video became available in more than 200 countries and territories, following the November debut of <i>The Grand Tour,<\/i> Amazon\u2019s mostwatched premiere ever. Twitch, the streaming video-game network that Amazon acquired in 2014, unveiled its first three original titles from its recently formed studios. Amazon invested millions in startups that will build voice-control apps for the intelligent assistant Alexa and give her thousands of new skills. The company opened two dozen new fulfillment centers, became the largest online store in India, and made its first delivery by autonomous drone in the United Kingdom.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>\u201cOUR CUSTOMERS ARE LOYAL TO US RIGHT UP UNTIL THE SECOND SOMEBODY OFFERS THEM A BETTER SERVICE,\u201d CEO BEZOS SAYS. \u201cAND I LOVE THAT. IT\u2019S SUPERMOTIVATING FOR US.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Bezos\u2019s strategy of continuous evolution has allowed the company to experiment in adjacent areas\u2014and then build them into franchises. The website that once sold only books now lets anyone set up a storefront and sell just about anything. The warehouse and logistics capabilities that Amazon built to sort, pack, and ship those books are available, for a price, to any seller. Amazon Web Services, which grew out of the company\u2019s own e-commerce infrastructure needs, has become a $13 billion business that not only powers the likes of Airbnb and Netflix, but stores your Kindle e-book library and makes it possible for Alexa to tell you whether or not you\u2019ll need an umbrella today.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is a singular enterprise, one that rises to the top of <i>Fast Company<\/i>\u2019s Most Innovative Companies list because it has continued to be nimble even as it has achieved enviable scale. To truly understand how Bezos is meshing size and agility in 2017, though, you need to look beyond sales figures ($100 billion in 2015) and the stock price (up more than 300% in the past five years) and consider three initiatives that drive Amazon today: Prime, the company\u2019s rapidly proliferating $99-per-year membership program; an incursion into the physical world with brick-and-mortar stores, something the company has long resisted; and a restless rethinking of logistics, epitomized by a new fulfillment center an hour outside Seattle that features high-tech robots working alongside human workers like a factory of the future.<\/p>\n<p>Our mobile-first, on-demand world finds its roots in Amazon\u2019s founding idea: that digital commerce will radically reshape our marketplace. The company\u2019s impact has already been staggering. In January, the nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance conducted a survey of nearly 3,000 independent businesses, half of them retailers, asking them to cite the biggest threats they faced. Competition from chains and big-box stores, health care, finding employees, and rising rents all ranked near the bottom as modest concerns. \u201cWay above everything was competition from Amazon,\u201d says ILSR codirector Stacy Mitchell. (The study also found that Amazon\u2019s expansion in 2015 led to a net loss across all businesses of 149,000 jobs.)<\/p>\n<p>Despite all the twists and surprises in recent decades\u2014 all the newcomers with youth, funding, and can-do enthusiasm\u2014 Amazon remains the undisputed leader, a startup at heart still striving to remake our expectations. And to repeatedly remake itself.<\/p>\n<p><b>Nearly all of<\/b> Amazon\u2019s most recent innovations share a connection to Prime, which by some estimates accounts for 60% of the total dollar value of all merchandise sold on the site. Between 40 million and 50 million people in the United States use Prime, and, according to Morgan Stanley, those customers spend around $2,500 on Amazon annually, more than four times what nonmembers spend. (Amazon refuses to offer any hard numbers related to Prime membership\u2014 that would be competitor focused rather than customer obsessed, as the executives there say\u2014but it will confirm that Prime members spend more and shop across a greater number of categories than other users.)<\/p>\n<p>If you somehow manage to take advantage of every Prime membership feature, it\u2019s undeniably a good bargain. Along with free two-day shipping for millions of products, and tens of thousands of items available at your door in an hour or less through Prime Now, there is one-hour restaurant delivery, a free e-book a month (including the entire <i>Harry Potter<\/i> series), and ad-free viewing of a streaming video-game channel on Twitch\u2014all included in the annual fee. You can get early access to Amazon\u2019s best deals, 20% off diapers, and unlimited photo storage. For a few more dollars, Prime can be upgraded to include unlimited audiobooks, grocery delivery, and a subscription to HBO that can be watched on Amazon\u2019s Fire TV streaming media player. More than 50 \u201cbenefits\u201d were added for members around the globe in the second half of 2016 alone, says Greg Greeley, Amazon\u2019s global VP in charge of Prime. \u201cI would like to say that the team thinks, \u2018Oh, boy, we\u2019ll take a deep breath here,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cBut the way this company [is], it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we continue to keep accelerating.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What Amazon Prime is selling most of all is time. Every executive I spoke to, when asked about how it all fits together, cites this desire to get you whatever you want in the shortest window possible. Stephenie Landry, the Amazon vice president who launched Prime Now in 2014 and has overseen its expansion into 49 cities in seven countries, explains that her business merely has to answer two questions: \u201cDo you have what I want, and can you get it to me when I need it?\u201d The rest of the customer experience is built around answering both questions in the affirmative.<\/p>\n<p>The more products and services Amazon is able to cram into Prime, the more likely users are to renew their membership and buy more stuff, which gives Amazon more data about their tastes and what they are likely to buy next. That information is used to spin out new products and services, such as the Dash button, which replenishes popular items with a tap, and Alexa, which is built, in part, for shopping. \u201cYou can just say, \u2018Alexa, reorder toothpaste,\u2019 \u201d says Bezos. \u201cAnd it knows which kind of toothpaste.\u201d That\u2019s why he has repeatedly called Prime the company\u2019s \u201cflywheel\u201d: a device used in engines that provides constant energy. It is both an accelerant to Amazon\u2019s forward motion and a beneficiary.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>\u201cTHE WAY THIS COMPANY [IS], IT WOULDN\u2019T SURPRISE ME IF WE CONTINUE TO KEEP ACCELERATING,\u201d SAYS GREG GREELEY, AMAZON\u2019S HEAD OF PRIME.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Bezos says that<\/b> people have been asking him for 20 years whether he would ever open physical stores. The answer, consistently, has been no. \u201cI\u2019ve answered pretty much the same way the whole time, which is that we will if we have a differentiated idea,\u201d Bezos tells me. Yet today, suddenly, Amazon has four concepts in the works.<\/p>\n<p>Why the shift? In part it links back to Prime; retail stores offer a tangible lure for the uninitiated. But, as Bezos explains, Amazon\u2019s technological sophistication also now makes it possible for in-store shoppers to interact with its digital platforms in all-new manners. Monitoring the interplay is a classic Amazon way to spot new opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>The first wave of Amazon stores is somewhat traditional: More than 30 pop-up shops showcasing Amazon\u2019s electronic gadgets\u2014Kindle, Echo, Fire TV, Fire tablets, and Dash buttons\u2014dotted the country by late last year. The next phase: expanding the highly curated Amazon Books stores\u2014which showcase titles with a higherthan- four-stars customer rating alongside excerpts of reviews from the website\u2014from three locations to eight. But it is the third leg of the company\u2019s retail experiment that begins to rattle expectations. Amazon Go is a convenience-store concept the company announced in December (it will launch publicly in Seattle in early 2017). After a shopper swipes a code on her mobile phone at the entryway turnstile, she can grab whatever items she likes; they are magically added to her digital cart and automatically paid for when she leaves, through her existing account. This ability to skip both the line and any cash register on the way out is made possible by Amazon\u2019s cloud computing, machine learning, voice control, and logistics know-how. It\u2019s also another example of Amazon creating a technology platform that could be sold to other businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, and more quietly, another grocery-store concept is also being prepped. Although no one inside Amazon is willing to talk about it, documents filed with local buildings departments in Seattle and the San Francisco suburbs of Sunnyvale and San Carlos show that the company is erecting stores in all three locales. (Construction at the Seattle location\u2014where a Chinese restaurant once stood, on a busy commercial thoroughfare in the fast-growing Ballard neighborhood\u2014appears to be nearly complete.) The documents describe a system that would seem to extend the AmazonFresh grocery service: Customers load their digital carts remotely and pay online, then schedule a physical pickup within a two-hour window. \u201cWhen picking up purchased items, customers either can drive into a designated parking area with eight parking stalls where the purchased items will be delivered to their cars, or they can walk into the retail area to pick up their items,\u201d the filings say.<\/p>\n<p>These stores are not likely to change the way most Americans get their cornflakes overnight. Still, Amazon has always been good at being patient\u2014and incrementally improving its offerings. Since AmazonFresh launched in 2007, the service has slowly expanded to dozens of cities. The Amazon neighborhood continues to change. <b>Planted on the<\/b> edge of a military base, Amazon\u2019s recently opened fulfillment center, in DuPont, Washington, looks from the outside like a generic warehouse, with a line of idling trucks snaking around the building waiting to load and unload product. But what\u2019s inside represents a huge advance in the way Amazon sorts, packs, and ships orders.<\/p>\n<p>It starts with a \u201cvision tunnel,\u201d a conveyor belt tented by a dome full of cameras and scanners. As each box comes off the truck, it is photographed and scanned on all sides. Image-recognition algorithms then sort each parcel based on variables such as the type of product or size and weight. What takes humans with bar-code scanners an hour to accomplish at older fulfillment centers can now be done in half that time.<\/p>\n<p>Boxes are towed from the docks into the million-square-foot warehouse, sometimes by driverless vehicles. This facility handles the largest items that Amazon ships, which is why there\u2019s also a huge, 6-ton yellow robot on the main floor. It has a six-axis arm that could pick up a car with ease, but today it\u2019s mostly lifting pallets loaded 4 feet high with diapers and Keurig cups to the second floor of the warehouse where they will await shipping. The arm performs a constant, mostly silent waltz with an ensemble of rolling Amazon robots, which represent the next-generation offspring of the company\u2019s $775 million acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2012, and were only fully integrated into the fulfillment center workflow last year.<\/p>\n<p>Once a package leaves the warehouse, it may end up on a Boeing 767 with the Prime Air logo emblazoned on its side. Bezos rolled out the first in a fleet of 40 wide-bodies last summer, which will be operated in partnership with two aircraft-leasing companies. These planes, like the thousands of cargo trailers that already sport the Prime logo, make Amazon less dependent on its partnerships with FedEx, DHL, and the United States Postal Service. And, pending FAA approval, those fully operational Amazon delivery drones might one day cut delivery time down to 30 minutes or less.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon stresses that its new automated fulfillment centers actually require more human workers than the old ones did, because the warehouse can store a significantly larger number of products\u2014which all still need people for boxing and general oversight (plus, someone\u2019s got to service those robots when they need repairs). The plant in DuPont, active almost 24\/7, employs more than a thousand people full time. At stow station 1405, for instance, I watch a young guy with tattoos, a man bun, and large-gauge flesh-tunnel earrings grab item after item from orange robots, scan each one, and, after the computer gives the green light, send it to be boxed. Over the holiday season, Amazon hired an extra 120,000 workers at centers nationwide to help meet demand. This is what the future of American factory work might look like.<\/p>\n<p><b>Amazon\u2019s business is<\/b> not without its challenges. The company\u2019s imperative to deliver more stuff faster has racheted up its annual shipping costs north of $11 billion, reinforcing the pressure to wring efficiencies out of the company\u2019s processes and its people. In the run-up to last year\u2019s holiday shopping season, pilots who work for Amazon\u2019s Prime Air shipping contractors went on strike, demanding hiring increases to reduce their workload. It\u2019s no wonder that the blistering 2015 <i>New York Times<\/i> article about bruising work environments at Amazon remains in the popular consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is working to counteract this legacy. The company pledged in January to create more than 100,000 full-time positions over the next 18 months, and it\u2019s building a new headquarters complex in the heart of downtown Seattle. Five buildings and a 2,000-seat auditorium will surround a trio of glass-enclosed spheres that, when completed in 2018, will contain more than 3,000 species of plants and trees from around the world. There will be flexible, couch-filled work spaces and an \u201cExpressions Lab,\u201d where employees can learn to knit or attend a \u201cBob Ross Paint Night.\u201d One floor will include a small outdoor dog park, and there will be several markets and cafeterias. Amazon is also funding an additional streetcar for the city, as well as bicycle paths leading to the three-block complex, which includes 1.7 acres of public space. \u201cThe biggest thing is probably just that we\u2019re not in a suburban campus,\u201d says Bezos, \u201cwhich I think would change the vibrancy and energy of Amazon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In November, Amazon released a video ad portraying a pair of aging friends\u2014a priest and an imam\u2014laughing, hugging, and then ordering the same knee braces for each other. It is a sensitive and moving vignette, portraying Amazon as a connector of cultures, the kind of compassionate business it has not always been given credit for being. The ad arrived just two weeks after Donald Trump was elected president, so I ask Bezos what the company\u2019s role might be in bridging the divides that exist in the U.S. After all, he bankrolls <i>The Washington Post,<\/i> which went after Trump aggressively during the presidential campaign. His answer is almost laughably narrow. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you one way that I don\u2019t think anybody is divided,\u201d Bezos replies. \u201cEverybody wants fast delivery. Low prices. I\u2019m serious about this. Our job is to provide a great customer experience, and that is something that is universally desired all over the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s tough to argue with his words. And yet this Bezosian boilerplate is certainly less than the full story. Because Amazon is doing more than delivering our next tube of toothpaste. By using the \u201cdivine discontent of the customer as a North Star,\u201d as Bezos puts it, the company is energizing a culture of relentless progress. The neighborhood may be changing, but maybe that\u2019s good. Maybe that\u2019s what business in the modern era is all about.<\/p>\n",

Last August, it launched a program in Pittsburgh that allowed people to summon a self-driving car from their phones. At the same time, Uber acquired autonomous-trucking startup Otto. Together, these moves put the company, valued at $68 billion, at the forefront of transportation\u2019s next wave. \u201cThe biggest asset and advantage [of our self-driving efforts] is being part of the larger Uber network,\u201d says Raffi Krikorian, engineering director at the company\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh.<\/p>\n<h3><b>1 A smart pilot<\/b><\/h3><p>Uber deliberately chose Pittsburgh for its first fleet because of the city\u2019s erratic weather and winding roads. \u201cIf we can drive in Pittsburgh, we [know we] have the features we need to go and drive in other cities,\u201d Krikorian says. The project has since expanded to Phoenix.<\/p>\n<h3><b>2 Automotive allies<\/b><\/h3><p>Last summer, Uber signed a $300 million deal with Volvo, which provides the company\u2019s current fleet of humanassisted self-driving cars.

And it can\u2019t just shove the A10 where it doesn\u2019t belong. The S2 chip, for example, was developed to give the second-generation Apple Watch its lauded performance improvements without sacrificing battery life, and the magic trick of how AirPods simultaneously deliver music to two separate wireless devices is a direct result of programming embedded within their W1 chip. \u201cWe want to improve without compromise,\u201d says Shimpi.

They capture duck-face snaps with each other, with churros, and with each other with churros. A bored camera operator spots them in the outfield stands, and two middle-aged MLB announcers have a field day, mocking the women\u2019s youthful self-absorption.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best one of 300 pictures I\u2019ve taken of myself today!\u201d one commentator cracks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s my first bite of the churro!\u201d chirps his coconspirator. \u201cHere\u2019s my second bite of the churro!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeralta knocks it into center! . . . And nobody noticed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The clip went viral because, from the perspective of the MLB broadcast crew, the students seemed disconnected from events on the field. But the sorority sisters weren\u2019t living their lives for the TV cameras. They were, in fact, having a great time at the game\u2014via Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers, advertisers, influencers, media brands, and rivals are increasingly viewing the world through Snapchat\u2019s lens. In the past 18 months, the photo- and video-sharing app has released a slew of bold (and brazenly imitated) features, from absurdist digital masks to face-swapping to group chat, which have vaulted it to the vanguard of social communication. Snap, as the company is now known, claims more than 150 million daily users, and it reportedly exceeded its lofty goal to generate more than $300 million in revenue for 2016. Its introduction of location-based image enhancements, known as geofilters, and Spectacles, its sunglasses that record 10 seconds of video from the wearer\u2019s point of view, inspired genuine consumer fanaticism for augmented reality and wearable computing in a way that overhyped rivals from Magic Leap to Google haven\u2019t matched. As Snap is expected to go public this year, deconstructing the principles underpinning its products is more important than ever. After all, the only people who underestimate Snap are those who don\u2019t take the time to see what\u2019s right in front of their face.<\/p>\n<p><b>When Snapchat rebranded<\/b> last September to Snap, CEO Evan Spiegel proclaimed it a camera company. At first blush, it\u2019s a curious bit of branding\u2014Kevin Systrom, founder of Snapchat rival Instagram, ardently argues that he runs a communications company\u2014but Snap\u2019s framing is intentional. Camera technologies have driven some of the most important developments in media. In 1888, Thomas Edison\u2019s Kinetograph gave birth to motion pictures, and provided Edison with early control over the film industry. In 1957, NBC upgraded to color broadcasting, largely so its owner, RCA, could sell color TVs. Kodak, once one of the world\u2019s most valuable brands, continues to sell off imaging patents to a new generation of camera-obsessed companies, including Facebook, Google, and Apple.<\/p>\n<p>Visual information is a conduit for the digitized relationships of the modern era, and Snap effortlessly navigates this confluence of image, communication, and entertainment. Its most impressive illusion is that its app design feels casual or even random, when in fact, it\u2019s a carefully thought-out experience, constantly being honed for maximum engagement. Whether it\u2019s offering up cartoon ghost Snapcode Stickers for you to add a new friend or puppy-nose filters to apply to your face, Snapchat\u2019s interface reinforces that it\u2019s for fun. \u201cThey treat their core product like a utility, and they aren\u2019t overly precious about it, \u201d says Ryan Rimsnider, Taco Bell\u2019s senior manager of social strategy. \u201cAnd if they are, they certainly don\u2019t act like it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For the past two decades, user-interface design has put a premium on an intuitive placement of functions. By contrast, Snapchat forces users to play around. Its design operates like a speakeasy, requiring you to feel for the secret door or have a friend who knows the passcode to unlock the next room. Many of Snapchat\u2019s features, such as long-pressing on your face to bring up filters or being able to convert yourself into an emoji, need to be discovered. Adding people to follow, whether they\u2019re celebrities or your friends, is another clandestine game, one that rewards good creators rather than merely famous people. And Snap doesn\u2019t generally issue press releases announcing app updates, preferring that users are surprised when they find new features on their own. Snapchat is therefore free to experiment more aggressively than competitors with UI shifts and features\u2014 and even break its own rules without breaking the app. This is why Snapchat has been able to evolve from only allowing photos taken in the moment, which would disappear in 10 seconds, to adding Memories, which makes old content searchable, without a revolt.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0036-0116\/40220-1-eng-US\/f0036-012.jpg\" width=\"866\" height=\"978\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0036-01\" title=\"f0036-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Kelly Oxford<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by Ramona Rosales<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>Ultimately, what Snap<\/b> offers users is control. \u201cThey just want to provide crazy tools that enable fans to create stories with no end,\u201d says Rimsnider. Take Snapchat\u2019s augmented-reality lenses. These silly filters solve an important problem: They give people something to do when they share. Puking a digital rainbow, one of Snapchat\u2019s photo enhancements, is a prop to overcome stage fright when messaging friends.<\/p>\n<p>Stories, a collection of images and video that capture a user\u2019s day and last 24 hours, has become the centerpiece of the Snapchat experience. \u201cSnapchat is the reality show about your life that you shoot and edit yourself,\u201d says Jason Stein, CEO of both the marketing agency Laundry Service and Cycle, a media startup. Indeed, some of the most renowned Snapchatters, such as Julz Goddard (better known as YesJulz), effectively use the app to produce a series starring themselves. \u201cI was talking to different networks about a reality show, but I wasn\u2019t really excited about other people having creative control over my content and my image,\u201d Goddard says. \u201cThen I was like, Wow, this Snapchat is incredible. Everyone in the world can have their very own television network.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0037-014\/40213-1-eng-US\/f0037-012.jpg\" width=\"867\" height=\"978\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0037-01\" title=\"f0037-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Manny Mua<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by Aaron Feaver<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>Snap is watching what its users create and deploying those insights to woo Hollywood talent to embrace the platform as a new entertainment medium. The company is in talks with talent agencies and media companies to create scripted and unscripted \u201cSnapchat shows\u201d for the platform. The Snap twist, according to one Hollywood insider: The four-minute-long series would be divided into 10- to 60-second chapters, much like users\u2019 Stories are structured. When Snap internally produced its own test program\u2014the election-year series <i>Good Luck America<\/i>\u2014it even had the crew shoot host Peter Hamby off-center, at arm\u2019s length, to create the impression that he was filming himself. In dealings with traditional media partners such as NBC, which creates <i>The Voice on Snapchat<\/i> and a recurring Jimmy Fallon segment, Snap has offered shot-by-shot analytics from <i>Good Luck America,<\/i> showing how pacing that\u2019s too slow, or shots that are too dull, will lose viewers in the middle of a video. Ultimately, Snap sees user-generated and Hollywood content evolving codependently, with each building off the other.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0038-0115\/40206-1-eng-US\/f0038-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"863\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-01\" title=\"f0038-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Justin Kan<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by Molly Matalon (Kan);<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0038-026\/40199-1-eng-US\/f0038-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"863\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-02\" title=\"f0038-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CyreneQ<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nCru Camara (CyreneQ)<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>DESIGNER REBECCA MINKOFF COMPARES SPECTACLES TO A PARTY DRESS OR SHOES, AN OVERT PIECE OF FLAIR THAT CALLS ATTENTION TO ITS INTENT.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Snap\u2019s advertising business directly benefits from the tools it creates for Snapchatters. The design team that builds Snap\u2019s consumer features also creates its advertising products; every tool for marketers began its life delighting users. For example, Snapchat\u2019s Discover channels, which feature original content from media brands such as National Geographic and Vice, introduced the idea that you swipe up to learn more about a given story. \u201cAfter months of training the behavior,\u201d says Kenny Mitchell, Gatorade\u2019s director of consumer engagement, \u201cSnapchat then launched Snap Ads that allow for consumers to swipe up to get more info.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Snap\u2019s most intriguing ad product has been sponsored lenses, which has attracted the world\u2019s best brand marketers, including Disney, McDonald\u2019s, and Starbucks. For Cinco de Mayo, Taco Bell released a filter that turned people\u2019s heads into, yes, giant tacos. By most estimates, Taco Bell spent between $500,000 and $750,000 on a filter that was viewed 224 million times in a single day. That\u2019s double the views of a Super Bowl ad for one-tenth the price, and, unlike TV viewers, Snapchat\u2019s audience is actively using, sharing, and having fun with an ad.<\/p>\n<p>Users are already accustomed to adorning their faces with gags to make their friends laugh, so it doesn\u2019t matter that the gag is sponsored. Snap goes so far as to measure what it calls \u201cplay time\u201d\u2014how long a user might toy with a giant taco on their face, even if they never take a photo wearing it. Because it\u2019s still valuable engagement. \u201cThey\u2019re really trying to make social ads suck less,\u201d says Winston Binch, chief digital officer of Deutsch North America, which works closely with Taco Bell\u2019s social strategy team. \u201cThey\u2019re not trying to reappropriate other digital advertising norms. They want to maintain the integrity of the experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0038-034\/40192-1-eng-US\/f0038-032.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"863\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-03\" title=\"f0038-03\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Kenny Mitchell<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by Lyndon French<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>in november, Snap<\/b> introduced yet another strategy to make its platform even more addictive, capable, and advertiser-friendly: hardware. Snap Spectacles transform Snapchat the app into a brash sunglasses-camera that takes circular videos. Spectacles, or Specs, as Snap employees call them, eliminate that final point of friction of pulling a phone from one\u2019s pocket to capture life\u2019s spontaneity. They encourage sharing by design: When they initially pair with your phone, Specs actually film your first snap without warning. (After that, a tap of the frame initiates recording.) \u201cHaving a pair has already made a dent in the type of content I\u2019m making,\u201d says Mike Platco, a Snapchat artist and influencer. \u201cIt has made me more excited to post \u2018in the moment\u2019 videos that are less focused on a large narrative and more about bringing my audience in on the cool stuff I get to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Recently I wore Specs during a Chicago birthday bar crawl, capturing scenes that I\u2019d never have filmed with my phone. Walking into each dive felt Scorsese-esque as I filmed it, as if I was shooting my own <i>Goodfellas,<\/i> but grittier. With both of my hands free to stuff my face, I captured a late-night tamale run as a tube of masa flying right below the camera. If I wanted a selfie, I had to have one of those cinematic moments of staring placidly into a bathroom mirror. Unlike Google Glass, which prompted \u201cGlasshole\u201d bans at New York and San Francisco bars, Specs are designed to be nonthreatening. (A playfully twirling LED light broadcasts that they\u2019re filming.)<\/p>\n<p>Spectacles ingeniously package this face camera into something that people might actually <i>want<\/i> to wear. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic shape reinvented,\u201d says fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff of the Ray-Ban\u2013inspired shades, which come in black, coral, and teal. She thought Glass was hideous, but compares Spectacles to a party dress or shoes, an overt piece of flair that calls attention to its intent rather than hiding it.<\/p>\n<p>Specs, which Snap conspicuously branded a \u201ctoy\u201d when it announced them last fall, are likely just the first physical camera that the company will introduce. Reports have circulated that it has considered other forms of wearable cameras, as well as drones. Snap has already tested selling a number of pieces of official merchandise, such as beach towels and backpacks, that hint at how the company thinks about bridging the real and digital worlds. When Snapchat introduced official playing cards, they were more or less a normal deck of cards, save for one thing: They came with instructions for a game called SnapKings. To play, a group of friends in the same room sets the cards on the table, but the game unfolds on Snapchat itself. If you draw a 3, you are instructed to \u201cSnap yourself while making your grossest selfie face.\u201d If you pull out a 9, you have to \u201cBust a rhyme for a 10-second Snap.\u201d Much as with lenses, the cards initiate a Snap session, transforming a mellow Friday night into fodder for an expanding universe of good times.<\/p>\n<p>Despite Snap\u2019s relentless creativity and distinct perspective, its future success isn\u2019t assured. Facebook has been rapidly adding Snapchat-like features into Facebook, Whats- App, and, most notably, Instagram. The rise of Instagram Stories, the 24-hour video-sharing tool that blatantly mimics Snapchat Stories, precipitated Snap\u2019s decision to pursue an IPO, according to one source. \u201cIt definitely caught them off guard,\u201d says a person who does business with Snap. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge threat.\u201d With Facebook trying to choke off its rival\u2019s global expansion, investors could also inhibit Snap\u2019s progress by dogging its stock if user and revenue growth don\u2019t exceed the high bar Facebook set for social media.<\/p>\n<p>But Spiegel and company understand instinctually that power has shifted. The kids know what they\u2019re doing. They know what they like. And Snap isn\u2019t afraid to tell media companies and advertisers, <i>Hey, shoot this more like the kids do<\/i>. What those career baseball broadcasters missed as they jeered the Alpha Chi sisters? Those duck-faced women were now the ones in control of the cameras, and they have countless stories to tell.<\/p>\n<p><i>Additional reporting\/writing by Jeff Beer, Claire Dodson, and Nicole LaPorte<\/i><\/p>\n<h3><b>JULZ GODDARD<\/b><\/h3><p><b>Mission:<\/b> Power publicist YesJulz lives her life on Snapchat, sharing behind-the-scenes glimpses of cool parties and time with clients like Gucci Mane.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy Snapchat followers are like my family.

But scale is only part of what\u2019s driving that dazzling success: COO Sheryl Sandberg and her team have been relentlessly experimenting with how to make ads more compelling despite the limitations of small screens. \u201cCreativity\u2019s never been so important,\u201d Sandberg says. \u201cWhen TV ads [first appeared], people thought the creative was important. Then when you moved into online, what really mattered was the targeting. What we\u2019re [now] seeing on the Facebook platform is that it\u2019s both.\u201d Over the past year, Facebook rolled out several new mobile ad formats, including fullscreen, 360-degree video, and interactive ads that let users swipe, tilt, and zoom through carousels of images. And to help advertisers experiment with and make sense of these products, in November Facebook debuted the Creative Hub, a platform for businesses and agencies to mock up, share, and test ads. With Facebook\u2019s growing focus on video, it\u2019s also encouraging marketers to adapt their materials specifically to the social network (rather than just repost ready-made TV spots). When Sony Pictures added subtitles to its movie trailers last spring and recut them into a more news feed\u2013friendly square format, it found them five times more effective in raising awareness than standard reposted previews. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take your ads that were on the last platform and then port them over to the new one,\u201d Sandberg says.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is also enabling a more direct connection between online engagement and real-world commerce. Already some brands have used targeting to double the revenue yield from news-feed campaigns, such as when Celebrity Cruises showed users trip itineraries based on Facebook\u2019s insights into where they were planning to visit. The next step is letting users complete the transaction without leaving the platform. In October, Facebook turned its Events calendar into a stand-alone app, allowing groups of friends to, say, buy concert tickets through the service, thanks to its relationships with Ticketmaster and Eventbrite. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about how to make Facebook more useful,\u201d says Andrew Bosworth, VP of ads and business platform. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 60 million businesses [with official pages] on the platform. We\u2019ve got 1.8 billion people. All we need to do is connect them.\u201d The marriage of social recommendations with commerce is rapidly attracting advertisers: 4 million on Facebook, 500,000 on Instagram. As Sandberg says, \u201cWe want to help them move products off shelves and drive cars off lots.\u201d<\/p>\n",

The redesign encourages Netflix\u2019s more than 93 million subscribers to serendipitously discover what to watch rather than tediously browse its catalog and wonder if something is worth sampling. The upgrade, a companywide effort that took nearly three years, demonstrates Netflix\u2019s commitment to stand out from competitors such as Amazon for more than just content (though Netflix is planning to produce 1,000 hours of original shows in 2017 and plow $6 billion into its library, numbers that far outpace its rivals). The company also recently unleashed Download and Go, which allows users to watch shows like <i>Stranger Things<\/i> and <i>The Crown<\/i> offline. \u201cWe started [2016] by making Netflix available everywhere,\u201d says Jaffe of the company\u2019s then-surprise expansion into 130 new countries. \u201cWe ended it with making sure you could take it anywhere with you.\u201d<\/p>\n",

Together, they inked a deal that gives Spielberg\u2019s Amblin Entertainment production company the financial backing of the e-commerce giant, along with its marketing savvy and substantial distribution power\u2014the elusive keys, in other words, to making a truly global blockbuster.<\/p>\n<p>Ma, a film buff who reportedly loves <i>The Godfather<\/i> and calls Forrest Gump his hero, had circled Hollywood for some years, and even committed $1.5 billion to a film fund that helped bankroll and market <i>Star Trek Beyond<\/i> and <i>Mission: Impossible\u00d1Rogue Nation,<\/i> but this was his first direct alliance. At a press conference announcing the deal, the titans, dressed alike in dark suits with cups of tea between them, heaped praise on each other. \u201cI never thought in my life I\u2019d see this legendary master,\u201d Ma told the crowd in Beijing, while touting the \u201ccultural bridge\u201d they were building. Spielberg declared that the deal will allow them to \u201cbring more China to America, and bring more America to China.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The sight of Spielberg, the quintessentially American storyteller, seated alongside Ma, the quintessentially Chinese tech entrepreneur, was more than just a signal of China\u2019s growing influence on the film industry. It was also the latest in a string of recent developments illuminating just how much Chinese companies are influencing some of the most innovative and important U.S. businesses. With a market that some observers argue has become the most dynamic in the world, China has become a colossal source of capital and creative thinking well beyond its shores. Increasingly, it is leading the way in everything from mobile software and services to devices and entertainment. And it\u2019s accelerating the pace for the rest of the world, whether or not consumers know it.<\/p>\n<p>Alibaba is just one of a slew of ambitious Chinese tech companies that has been at the forefront of the convergence between China and America. What they have in common is a birthplace that\u2019s more crucible than cradle. This year, the Chinese box office will likely eclipse the U.S.\u2019s. So too could the value of venture-backed investments in China, which approached $50 billion last year (up 943% since 2013). China now ties or tops the U.S. market in online retail, mobile device sales, digital payments, gaming, renewable energy investments, and more. With more than half of its 1.37 billion citizens online, 90% of them via smartphone, China has seen an explosion of tech behemoths and upstarts driving innovation hubs like Beijing and Shenzhen to become more hypercompetitive than even Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>Less than a decade ago, China\u2019s reputation was for spinning out shameless copycats of Western products, but today the model has been flipped. Spurred by an influx in VC dollars and talent, increased product sophistication, and a market maturing to meet the unique demands of China\u2019s population, \u201cyou ended up with this different evolution from the rest of the world, a continental internet broken off from the Pangaea, which led to different interfaces, different market dynamics,\u201d says Calvin Chin, CEO of Shanghaibased accelerator Transist Impact Labs. Then things really picked up steam. \u201cImagine <i>The Hunger Games<\/i>,\u201d says Connie Chan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who analyzes the Chinese technology industry. \u201c[It comes down to] the sheer size [of the country]. For any one company in the U.S., there might be 10 equivalents in China. In order to survive, you have to iterate that much faster.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This kind of rivalry has catapulted social media platforms WeChat and Alipay well past their American counterparts. When WeChat, which is owned by Tencent, launched six years ago, it was a mere chat app, while Alibaba\u2019s Alipay basically acted as a PayPal for the company\u2019s e-commerce marketplaces. But in fewer than two years, WeChat gained 200 million users, and soon expanded into mobile payments, a move that Alibaba\u2019s Ma called a \u201cPearl Harbor attack\u201d on his company. The fierce competition led to a spree of innovations, which, by 2015, had propelled China\u2019s mobile-transaction volume ahead of the U.S.\u2019s, to $235 billion, and morphed WeChat and Alipay into services that have become the envy of Facebook, Google, and Snapchat. Hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers now depend on these all-in-one apps to do, well, everything: interact with friends; pay for cabs and utility bills; book hotels, flights, and even dentist appointments; find love; and read news.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. tech companies have long dreamed of building that kind of universal experience on a single platform, and they\u2019re now scrambling to re-create what\u2019s become standard in China. This year, Facebook began experimenting with incorporating WeChat-inspired customer-service bots and other business features into Messenger, while Snapchat has toyed with integrating payments into its communication platform. Meanwhile, Tencent is already orchestrating its next paradigm shift: It just unveiled Mini Program, a new platform that allows other services to build versions of their apps inside WeChat (like bots, but better), which some believe could transform the messaging service into a full operating system. Albert Liu, EVP of corporate development at Verifone, which partnered with Alipay in October to bring its payments service to North America, now doesn\u2019t know whether to call these messaging platforms \u201csuper apps\u201d or gateways to the internet. \u201cThe advantage of super lifestyle apps like Alipay or WeChat is they\u2019ve connected incrementally more data than an app that\u2019s just focused on a single area: Alipay knows where you\u2019ve traveled, what movies you saw, what restaurants you ate at,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no comparison with anything in the U.S. Maybe Facebook eventually gets there\u2014maybe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The velocity of competition is just as torrid in the hardware market. Google veteran Hugo Barra, who recently stepped down as Xiaomi vice president, has witnessed firsthand the extreme market fluctuations in China, where new brands displace incumbents with lightning speed. When Barra joined Xiaomi in late 2013, the then-three-year-old hardware maker was rocketing to become the No. 1 smartphone maker in China. Clever flash sales of its sleek flagship Mi devices (which rivaled the iPhone in quality) created fervor, and weekly operating-system updates made consumers feel like they were part of the design process. In 2015, with Xiaomi\u2019s growth slowing, Huawei, a telecom manufacturing giant, stole its crown, thanks to its carrier relationships and a massive investment in using its expertise to build its own consumer devices. And then Oppo and Vivo, subsidiaries of BBK Electronics, dominated 2016, by smartly targeting lesser-developed cities (which by American standards are still enormous) while pushing youth-oriented features, such as the new Vivo V5\u2019s 20-megapixel front-facing camera, the perfect tool for the selfie-obsessed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cChinese technology companies, both in hardware and software, are moving so fast from one generation to the next,\u201d Barra says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much resource investment here, so much productivity, and obviously the fact that the supply chain is [in China] makes things easier too.\u201d You can be sure that Apple, whose China market share slipped 37% in a single quarter last year, is studying every move. Huawei recently announced its new Mate 9, the first smartphone embedded with Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant. And by the time the iPhone 8 finally lands this fall with a rumored bezel-less display, Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Mix smartphone, which features a stunning edge-to-edge screen that reviewers have called the future of mobile devices, will have already been on the market for close to a year. \u201cThe average Chinese consumer has become incredibly discerning,\u201d says Barra. \u201cTheir demand for consumer innovation is ahead of any other market in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>In the past<\/b> year, no industry has attracted more Chinese interest (and raised American alarm) than entertainment, which Chinese companies are pursuing with a mix of prodigious capital and strategic deal-making. Tencent and real estate giant Dalian Wanda have joined Alibaba in committing billions of dollars to help produce the kind of technologically ambitious and expensive film and TV projects that appeal to global audiences. Given the idiosyncrasies of the Chinese market (traditional Western advertising campaigns tend to fall flat there, and the country places strict quotas on non-Chinese films), American studios need to partner with these companies to access this key element of the global box office. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to spend over $100 million on a movie and ignore the Chinese market,\u201d says Max Michael, head of Asian business development for the United Talent Agency, \u201cyou\u2019re not doing your job right.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0049-014\/40387-1-eng-US\/f0049-012.jpg\" width=\"1158\" height=\"725\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-01\" title=\"f0049-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>China, in turn, is intent on learning the ins and outs of filmmaking from Hollywood as it builds up its own moviemaking infrastructure. In 2016, for example, Wanda chairman Wang Jianlin, the richest man in China (just ahead of Alibaba\u2019s Ma), helped orchestrate the acquisition of Legendary Entertainment, the production company behind <i>The Dark Knight<\/i> and <i>The Hangover,<\/i> for $3.5 billion. Wang previously purchased U.S.-based AMC Theatres, which made Wanda the biggest cinema operator in the world, and more recently struck a high-profile deal with Sony Pictures to cofinance and market Sony movies in China. (Last November, he also acquired prolific awards-show producer Dick Clark Productions.) Wang is said to be looking to make similar deals with the other major studios, while working to entice Hollywood to film at Wanda\u2019s new $8 billion production facility in Qingdao. \u201cThe Chinese market loves Hollywood content. At the same time, they love to learn from Hollywood,\u201d says Jack Gao, Wanda\u2019s head of international investments and operations.<\/p>\n<p>The implication of these aggressive moves is palpable. Wanda\u2019s acquisition streak has led members of Congress to request a Justice Department investigation into potential \u201cforeign propaganda influence over American media.\u201d Meanwhile, in the smartphone arena, suspicions of Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese government have kept the telecom company from spreading its wares in the U.S. With isolationist trade policies and a more combative relationship with China likely during the Trump administration, some American and Chinese companies and investors with interests linking the world\u2019s two largest economies are apprehensive about the years ahead.<\/p>\n<p>But whether or not a specific product or brand from China ever becomes ubiquitous in the U.S., the underlying innovations are already being imported and exported, impacting Americans regardless.

(Edward Snowden is a fan.) Facebook announced in April that messages sent on the latest versions of WhatsApp would automatically be encrypted with the protocol, and the social networking giant is using it to add a secret messaging mode to its Messenger app as well. Google included the technology in its Allo messaging product, released in September. In addition to security, Signal has recently added features that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in commercial services: It now includes a search tool for GIFs, can sync conversations between mobile and desktop versions, and\u2014 naturally\u2014offers messages that automatically disappear after a few seconds.<\/p>\n",

They\u2019re helped by Illumination\u2019s characters, which communicate in a universal visual language, care of the studio\u2019s diverse group of international artists. And in a rare move, Illumination retains control over licensing deals and partnerships, working to create original stories for projects such as the <i>Minion Rush<\/i> mobile game (which has 750 million users) and the Minion Mayhem rides currently at a handful of Universal Studios theme parks (Universal co-owns the Illumination brand with Meledandri).

A lot of companies develop a single product, Pedersen says, \u201cbut if you try to add additional services and products to your home, they\u2019re completely uncoordinated.\u201d Instead, Vivint\u2019s 1.2 million customers sign up for packages that include the installation of hardware (both its own and that of other companies, such as Nest); 24\/7 tech support; repair services; and the seamless coordination of everything\u2014from doorbell cameras to thermostats \u2014via the Vivint app. Last year, this strategy increased annual revenue by roughly 15%, to more than $650 million. The company is now launching an AI assistant that analyzes customers\u2019 behavior to anticipate their preferences. In another grab at the mainstream, Vivint struck a partnership with Airbnb that will let hosts link their accounts to Vivint, and use its equipment to interact with guests via a door cam and allow them keyless entry.<\/p>\n",

Commissioned to celebrate the launch of the French fashion house Kenzo\u2019s first fragrance, the surreal and surprising spot, which went viral in September and won a top industry award in November, led to a wildly successful soft launch of the perfume\u2014no paid media or marketing required. (Parent company LVMH cited the campaign as helping to drive the 8% growth in its perfumes and cosmetics division during the first nine months of 2016.) Kenzo creative directors Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, who also run the retailer and clothing brand Opening Ceremony, have consistently pushed Kenzo beyond fashion and into the larger realm of pop culture through creative risk-taking and collaboration. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for us to tap into culture in any way we can,\u201d says Leon. Two more visionary projects followed in a six-week period, including a Carrie Brownstein\u2013directed short satirizing the hyperbolic world of social media, which served as Kenzo\u2019s fall\/winter lookbook, and a video featuring Chance the Rapper that announced Kenzo\u2019s partnership with H&amp;M. \u201cWe don\u2019t come from a background of carefully mapped-out marketing,\u201d says Lim. \u201cWe just move.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0058-0116\/40626-1-eng-US\/f0058-012.jpg\" width=\"2624\" height=\"1629\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0058-01\" title=\"f0058-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>\u201cThere [is] no reason to be shy.

The millennial-minded Who What Wear collection offers runway trends at big-box prices ($34.99 for velvet pants, $44.99 for a cape blazer) and keeps up with the frenetic pace of fashion by committing to 12 updates a year. It\u2019s a natural evolution for the 11-yearold company, which grew out of the <i>Who What Wear<\/i> blog started by <i>Elle<\/i> magazine veterans Katherine Power and Hillary Kerr. \u201cWe felt that the high-end fashion magazines spoke down to women,\u201d says Power, who now serves as CEO. \u201cWe wanted to create this friendly voice that felt like your most fashionable friend.\u201d Today, Power\u2019s team uses the information gleaned from Clique Media\u2019s verticals and social media accounts to figure out what will sell. \u201cWe have amazing insight into what\u2019s converting: what brands, what silhouettes, what material,\u201d says Power. \u201cWe\u2019re also engaging the customer along the way. We\u2019ll be looking through fabric swatches and go on Snapchat and say, \u2018Which one do you like better?\u2019 \u201d The crowdsourcing has worked: Who What Wear\u2019s Target collection has recently expanded into shoes, and Clique Media has more retail collaborations in the works. Last July, Clique Media organized an IRL meetup for readers of <i>Obsessee,<\/i> its new social-only \u201cpublication\u201d for gen-Zers. It put together a pop-up shop at a Los Angeles mall that sold <i>Obsesse<\/i>e-branded T-shirts and school supplies. Teenagers thronged. Over the course of three days, the store processed more than 1,700 transactions. Revenue wasn\u2019t the only goal. \u201cEverything was sold for social currency,\u201d says Power. \u201cTo purchase something, you had to make a Snapchat or post an Instagram, and, of course, tag <i>Obsessee<\/i>.\u201d It\u2019s step one in building a content brand that sells.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0060-0116\/40619-1-eng-US\/f0060-012.jpg\" width=\"2588\" height=\"1620\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0060-01\" title=\"f0060-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Clique Media cofounders Power, left, and Kerr use their in-house data team to inform everything from website content to product development.<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by The Collaborationist<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><h3><b>27 | HYPEBEAST<\/b><\/h3><p>For uniting sneakerheads into a lucrative demographic<\/p>\n<p><b>\u201cIn the world<\/b> of hype, in the world of cool, you need to be the coolest platform selling the coolest products,\u201d says Kevin Ma, the unflappable founder of the Hong Kong\u2013based streetwear site <i>Hypebeast<\/i>. Championing edgy brands such as Raf Simons, Vetements, and Hood by Air, Ma\u2019s site has grown from a simple sneakerhead review hub (created in his Vancouver bedroom) to a multifaceted arbiter of all manner of urban fashion and culture that includes <i>Hypebeast,<\/i> the year-old female-focused <i>Hypebae,<\/i> and an online marketplace called HBX that sells everything from Yeezy Boosts to Leica cameras. Proof that Ma knows how to stay on just the right side of the hype cycle: Much of Hypebeast\u2019s 46% increase in revenue in the first six months of last year was fueled by its growing creative services division, which helps brands such as Gucci and Adidas produce advertising for both Ma\u2019s sites and others\u2019. Ma is also manipulating the tentacles of his operation to maximum effect. He ignites followers with weekly \u201cTop Drops\u201d on HBX, featuring sales of limited-edition sneakers and T-shirts, and leverages the data generated by <i>Hypebeast<\/i> and its associated sites to figure out what to stock on the e-commerce arm. \u201cOnce we publish an article about things that we think will be hot, we can see the data and reaction and engagement from the community,\u201d Ma says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of technology and so-called big data that influences our buying decisions.\u201d <i>Hypebae,<\/i> for example, was born last February from the insight that women account for 15% of the traffic to the male-dominated <i>Hypebeast<\/i>. The company is now growing its editorial staff as it prepares for further global expansion. The United States already accounts for more than half of its sales; mainland China and its billions of feet, Ma hopes, are next.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0062-0116\/40612-1-eng-US\/f0062-012.jpg\" width=\"2584\" height=\"1629\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0062-01\" title=\"f0062-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Ma transformed his former blog into a public company with the debut of Hypebeast on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year.<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by Chris Schoonover<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><h3><b>28 | REWARDSTYLE<\/b><\/h3><p>For giving influencers a must-have accessory<\/p>\n<p><b>RewardStyle is realizing<\/b> the social media world\u2019s longtime dream of converting influence into e-commerce opportunity. Founder Amber Venz Box has channeled her frustration as a fashion blogger who wanted to make more money into a full suite of back-end publishing and tracking tools. Today, RewardStyle allows her and her fellow bloggers and Instagram personalities the chance to earn commissions on the products they promote. \u201cOur mission is making [influencers] as economically successful as possible,\u201d she says. Users who like a RewardStyle influencer\u2019s \u2019gram receive an email on where to buy the featured look, a clever work-around that avoids forcing people to shop while they\u2019re browsing their feeds. Venz Box negotiates commissions for influencers and provides tools to help them track the impact of their posts. In 2016, RewardStyle grew its influencer network to 11,000 people (more than 100,000 have applied) and drove more than $700 million in sales for its retail partners, which include more than 4,000 stores and brands, among them Kate Spade and Sephora. Its stylish crew now creates original content for 30,000 products daily, much of it on Instagram. (RewardStyle\u2019s Instagram-optimized <a href=\"http:\/\/LiketoKnow.it\" target=\"_self\">LiketoKnow.it<\/a> platform drives almost 30% of the company\u2019s sales.) The company\u2019s data and its relationships help it make the best matches between retailers and pitch folk. \u201cIf [brands] want someone who drives a high volume of sales in accessories from $50 to $100 and lives in the Midwest,\u201d Venz Box says, \u201cwe can [connect them with] that person.\u201d As the shopping potential of Pinterest and Snapchat grows, RewardStyle is pushing to bring its tools to those platforms next.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_872\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0064-0118\/40605-1-eng-US\/f0064-012.jpg\" width=\"2595\" height=\"1629\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0064-01\" title=\"f0064-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>\u201c[We\u2019re] helping influencers professionalize,\u201d says RewardStyle founder Venz Box. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s the Wild West.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPhotograph by Trey Wright<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>",

As images of devastation looped across the nightly news, on the crowdfunding site GoFundMe there were flickers of hope\u2014in the form of digital payments. Moses Wells, a commercial fisherman in Edgewater, Maryland, started a GoFundMe campaign to deliver emergency supplies. \u201cI\u2019m raising money and donations to make multiple trips in a large box truck,\u201d he announced, and $2,381 poured in. In Boston, Louisiana State University fans raised $3,829 to help their bayou-based Tigers. In Texas, a Louisiana native organized an effort on behalf of his hometown: \u201cPlease help us as we are just Humans Helping Humans!\u201d Donors responded with $12,403. By the end of the year, funding efforts for Louisiana flood victims had raised $11.2 million.<\/p>\n<p>Humans helping humans has helped GoFundMe quietly become the biggest crowdfunding platform on the planet, responsible for more than $3 billion since its launch in 2010. It can now bring in as much as $140 million a month in donations, and generated an estimated $100 million in 2016 revenue. (A for-profit enterprise, it levies a 5% fee on campaigns, in line with other crowdfunding sites.) GoFundMe started as a bootstrapped operation that found its audience in the heartland by embracing virtually any personal cause, from honeyfunds to memorials. While coastal-centric crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo kept their focus on project-based campaigns, GoFundMe connected with families staring down foreclosure, medical bills, and tuition debt. Then, in the summer of 2015, investors, including Accel (which backed Facebook in 2005), acquired and recapitalized GoFundMe, seeking to build on its success and create a fundraising behemoth.<\/p>\n<p>The key to this transformation has been GoFundMe\u2019s cultivation of a new kind of campaign organizer: not just people looking for funds for themselves, but the proverbial Good Samaritan who jumped in after the Louisiana floods. At a basic level, Good Samaritans translate into more campaigns and more activated social networks. Add up their efforts, and the impact is profound: a realignment of how charitable aid is collected and distributed, especially in the United States. GoFundMe can raise millions in response to natural disasters and major news events\u2014$9 million for victims of the shooting at Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub, $7.8 million for protesters at Standing Rock, $3 million for Hurricane Matthew relief. In each case, the company provided distant bystanders with easy means to take action, and then worked behind the scenes to make their efforts go viral. Where the government and community organizations can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) help, there\u2019s GoFundMe. \u201cThe needs are gigantic,\u201d says chairman and CEO Rob Solomon. \u201cIf the holes weren\u2019t huge and gaping, GoFundMe wouldn\u2019t need to exist. We\u2019re this digital safety net\u201d\u2014with more than 25 million donors eagerly holding it up.<\/p>\n<p><b>At a time<\/b> when Twitter spats and Insta-glamour seem to dominate the hype cycle, GoFundMe has turned the oldfashioned value of neighborliness into an animating principle. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to look around them and see who might need help,\u201d says Solomon, a former Groupon and Yahoo executive who joined GoFundMe as part of its mid-2015 reinvention. Under his watch, GoFundMe has stayed true to its heartland roots while becoming a techworld star. \u201cWe talk a lot in Silicon Valley about technology changing the world,\u201d he says, \u201c[but individuals] haven\u2019t been empowered to change their worlds all that much.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>GoFundMe gives them control, thanks to a finely tuned product that optimizes for a \u201cpay it forward\u201d ethos. On campaign pages, for example, there is no simple Facebook-style \u201clike\u201d button, which would allow people to feel as though they\u2019re engaging with a project\u2014without contributing to it. \u201cLikes didn\u2019t actually help anyone,\u201d says chief technology officer Ujjwal Singh of GoFundMe\u2019s early experiments with the button. \u201cIt was an easy way out.\u201d Instead, visitors are given three options: donate, share on Facebook, or tweet. Similarly, in the automated emails that acknowledge donations, GoFundMe encourages sharing by telling people how much their promotion could be worth, in dollar terms, based on analyses of past campaigns. \u201cThat\u2019s had a dramatic impact on people sharing more,\u201d says Singh. When clicking post to facebook could be worth $100, it\u2019s hard to say no.<\/p>\n<p>This idea\u2014that a modicum of effort can produce outsize results\u2014translates into a new, viral mode of giving. In November, Arizona teacher Lisa Fandrich started a GoFundMe page on behalf of 76-year-old Paul Lomax, whom she had often seen selling copper coins on a busy corner in the Phoenix heat. \u201cWhy is a man of his advanced age out here?\u201d she recalls thinking. She pulled over to talk with him, and then turned to GoFundMe. She raised more than $30,000. \u201cOur elderly are not making it,\u201d says Fandrich, who worries about Lomax\u2019s ability to care for his wife and his house, which is in disrepair. She attributes the campaign\u2019s success (she initially set a target of $5,000) to the public\u2019s hunger for good news. \u201cPeople are so tired of the negativity on the news and social media,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want something to believe in.\u201d The site currently hosts 100,000 campaigns a month.<\/p>\n<p>GoFundMe owes its explosive reach to its ability to widely disseminate the good news that\u2019s taking place on its service. \u201cWe view ourselves as a content-distribution machine,\u201d says Dan Pfeiffer, who joined GoFundMe as its communications and policy chief in late 2015, after serving as a longtime adviser to President Obama. Pfeiffer\u2019s mandate is to help campaigns achieve breakout growth by seeding stories about them on social and traditional media. \u201cIn a world where the internet is starving for content, GoFundMe has more than almost any company,\u201d he says. All he needs is a Good Samaritan at the center of the story: \u201cThe campaigns that go really big are the ones where strangers are giving.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pfeiffer and his staff constantly monitor the platform for campaigns with a spike in shares or donations per minute. From there, they start pitching local press; as a story picks up, they reach out to a combination of legacy outlets (NBC\u2019s <i>Today, USA Today<\/i>) and share-friendly digital media, including <i>BuzzFeed<\/i> and <i>Refinery2<\/i>9. When a story starts to fade, they find ways to bring it back\u2014publishing a list of the top campaigns by state, for example. Last fall, $384,260 in donations poured in to establish a makeshift retirement fund for Fidencio Sanchez, an 89-year-old Chicago Popsicle-cart vendor, after the story was picked up by Chicago-area TV and radio, CNN, and more. In another era, in another place, a church or government program might have provided aging Americans like Sanchez with relief. No longer. \u201cGoFundMe presents a more efficient and effective way to access help,\u201d says Pfeiffer.<\/p>\n<p>GoFundMe\u2019s agnostic embrace of campaigns has served it well. While many organizers tug at the heartstrings (campaigns for children and pets consistently do well), just about any cause is fair game\u2014even fundraising for an abortion, which the company previously banned, is now permitted within legal bounds. Increasingly, the crowdfunding service is a vehicle to push political buttons. A search for \u201cPlanned Parenthood,\u201d for example, returns campaigns to help the organization alongside pages dedicated to replacing it. Solomon isn\u2019t concerned. \u201cWe\u2019re a neutral platform that\u2019s empowering people to help people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t up to me or the right or the left to be the arbiter of worthy causes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>\u201cWE\u2019RE A CONTENTDISTRIBUTION MACHINE,\u201d SAYS COMMUNICATIONS CHIEF DAN PFEIFFER. \u201cTHE INTERNET IS STARVING FOR CONTENT [AND] GOFUNDME HAS MORE THAN ALMOST ANY COMPANY.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In the coming months, it may become more difficult for GoFundMe to maintain this nonpartisan posture. But for Solomon, the current political environment\u2014in which major government investments in struggling communities have been stymied by partisan gridlock and distrust\u2014 underscores the company\u2019s broader opportunity. In January, GoFundMe acquired nonprofit fundraising platform CrowdRise, which has built Facebook-style pages for its members, in a bet that millions more people are interested in defining themselves based on the causes they support. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to solve [through public policy] the education problems, the medical problems, for years,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cThere\u2019s a populist movement around effecting change.\u201d And GoFundMe is its Good Samaritan.<\/p>\n",

Her company has enabled workers to earn an average of $35 per hour (nearly five times the federal minimum wage) by shifting away from a model that has \u201ctaskers\u201d bidding to win jobs to one that lets them set fixed prices for services, which include minor home repairs and house cleaning. In 2016, Brown-Philpot launched a mobile app that has sped the matching of taskers with tasks, and prioritized ondemand home services, a growing market. As a result, Task- Rabbit has quadrupled annual revenue and is profitable in each of its 18 cities. Brown-Philpot is raising the company\u2019s profile further by forging partnerships with major brands: TaskRabbit is now Ikea\u2019s exclusive service provider for help assembling items purchased at its London flagship.<\/p>\n",

For that, you\u2019ll need Orbital Insight. The Mountain View, California\u2013based company analyzes more than a million square kilometers of high-resolution imagery on a monthly basis from eight of the largest satellite constellations in orbit, and then uses machine-vision algorithms to put hard numbers on everything from the amount of water in reservoirs to the number of active fracking sites in North Dakota to the depth of poverty in Sri Lanka. \u201cWe call it a macroscope,\u201d says founder and CEO James Crawford, a former NASA robotics engineer who also led Google\u2019s mission to scan millions of books and make them searchable online. The U.S. government is an Orbital customer, as are more than 70 financial firms, some of which link into Orbital Insight to make market calls. The most popular report measures American retail strength by counting the number of cars in shopping-mall parking lots and predicting daily consumer spending. The newest offering, a World Oil Storage Index, could prove even more valuable: It determines global reserves by country by measuring the length of the shadows cast by the lids of 20,000 storage tanks. Orbital Insight\u2019s goal is more than economic, says Crawford. It\u2019s to \u201cunderstand what we\u2019re doing on the earth, and to the earth.\u201d The company recently partnered with World Resources Institute to detect patterns, such as when roads appear in previously untouched areas, that could help stop deforestation before it takes place.<\/p>\n",

So the three-year-old Farmers Business Network empowers growers to harvest each other\u2019s information. Big Ag may be consolidating, but FBN \u201cis reinventing the farm economy\u201d to fight back, says cofounder Charles Baron. The service aggregates and anonymizes data\u2014everything from seed and soil types to elevation and weather patterns\u2014 to create a crowdsourced database that eliminates guesswork. \u201cWe democratize the information,\u201d says Baron, \u201cfor farmers to share with each other and use for their own benefit.\u201d For between $500 and $600 a year, members of the collective can access performance data for more than 25 crops across 2,500 regularly grown seed lines. Growers can also track harvests in real time, giving them a jump on what the national market will look like months ahead of USDA analysts. In addition, FBN combines the buying power of its members to offer chemicals and fertilizer at up to 50% off. In 2016, FBN more than doubled its membership for a group that\u2019s now 3,200 farms strong, representing 11 million acres across 31 states.<\/p>\n",

It was only Casper\u2019s fourth major launch, after its high-tech foam mattress (which debuted in 2014) and extra-breathable sheets and pillow (2015), but it differed from those products in a major way. This one, it turned out, wasn\u2019t meant for humans.<\/p>\n<p>The Casper Dog Mattress, which sells for $125, promises \u201cto create a sleep environment that caters to canines\u2019 natural behaviors.\u201d An R&amp;D team spent 11 months conducting dog sleep studies, consulting with canine psychologists and churning through more than 100 prototypes. \u201cWhich is a crazy idea,\u201d admits Neil Parikh, one of Casper\u2019s five cofounders and its COO. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog bed!\u201d The mattress (\u201cDesigned for top dogs, by top dogs\u201d) is selling briskly. But that\u2019s only part of the value. As Parikh puts it, it\u2019s an opportunity \u201cto [show] people how we think\u2014to remind them that, \u2018Hey, here is a cool group of people that thinks in an interesting way.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to convince consumers that sleep is a pursuit as worthy of obsession as exercise or eating, you have to approach things differently. Three years after launching the original one-model-sleeps-all bed-in-a-box, Casper is combining science, design thinking, branding, and a winking sense of humor to redefine the humble mattress and its accoutrements into lifestyle statements. And its hundreds of thousands of customers are proving that being well rested is finally getting its due. The company, which pulled in an estimated $200 million\u2013plus in 2016 revenue (double the previous year\u2019s), has begun expanding internationally, entering Canada, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the U.K., with more countries soon to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ve set up the infrastructure so within a couple months we can turn on a new geography,\u201d says Parikh. \u201cWe\u2019ve got, like, a SWAT team that can go in [and be] operational within 8 to 10 weeks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To an outside observer, such excitement for selling mattresses\u2014a single model at that\u2014might seem curious. But, as their foray into dog beds demonstrates, Casper\u2019s founders are on a different mission. \u201cWhen we talk about becoming a lifestyle brand,\u201d says Luke Sherwin, another cofounder and the chief creative officer, \u201cit really is about the idea that whatever question you have about sleep, Casper will have an answer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Casper gets its<\/b> whimsy\u2014and relentless drive\u2014from its founders. Parikh, 27, dropped out of medical school, horrifying his physician parents (especially his sleep-doctor dad), to pursue sweet mattress-sales dreams with a group of guys he describes as his closest friends. Sherwin, 28, and chief technology officer Gabriel Flateman, 26, attended Brown University with Parikh. (When Sherwin describes fostering a company culture, he tends toward words like <i>dialectically<\/i>.) Chief product officer Jeff Chapin, 40, spent a decade at Ideo, where he designed toilets, car seats, and mattresses, the latter for one of the major players. And CEO Philip Krim, 33, first saw opportunity in mattresses as an undergrad at the University of Texas at Austin, where he sold them, among other products, via an early e-commerce startup he ran out of his dorm room. None of the five has kids, all are hyperarticulate and chatty, and their social and professional lives are completely intertwined. \u201cWhere we got lucky was that we found people we really enjoyed working with,\u201d says Parikh. \u201cPeople will hear us yelling in a room and looking like we\u2019re gonna throw shit at each other, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a part of our DNA that we debate everything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When Casper launched, in 2014, the founders\u2019 confidence in the idea was based on several core insights. One, of course, is that buying a mattress is typically an awful consumer experience. Another is that the vast margins (often 100% or more) that the major manufacturers bake in created an opportunity for a nimble new player. And then there were a whole series of fundamental assumptions about consumer behavior that the company cheerfully upended, from the idea that people want a mattress designed for their specific sleep style to the perception that word-of-mouth sales would be impossible to generate because nobody talks about their mattress (a notion that was shattered by an immediate boom in viral unboxing videos). \u201cMaybe [the videos were] a function of the fact that they like our brand, or the unboxing experience is exciting,\u201d says Parikh, referring to the way the mattress, which comes compressed into a surprisingly tiny roll, unfurls and expands in a dramatic fashion. \u201cBut the fact that people actually want to talk about sleep is pretty interesting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That last idea became a kind of umbrella insight\u2014that sleep is becoming a <i>thing,<\/i> a major lifestyle component, with a new cohort of evangelists proselytizing that the key to productivity and overall health stems from maximizing the quality of our slumber. (It\u2019s a belief that has found adherents in everyone from users of sleep-tracking apps to Arianna Huffington.) That thinking runs through all of Casper\u2019s subsequent products. Its sheets, for example, challenge the assumption that higher thread count equals higher quality. From both human testing and material-science research, Chapin\u2019s team concluded that densely woven sheets don\u2019t allow for cooling airflow, making the microclimate under the covers uncomfortably hot and humid. \u201cThe mattress, sheets, and pillow are fundamentally very simple things, so the science around the materials is really critical for how well they work,\u201d says Chapin. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at understanding things like pressure distribution and heat and moisture management.\u201d Chapin and friends are now building out an R&amp;D lab in San Francisco, which will allow for rapid prototyping and even in-house sleep-study bedrooms. Each space can be adjusted to mimic any possible sleep environment in terms of temperature, humidity, and other parameters. \u201cIt\u2019s sick,\u201d says Parikh. \u201c[We\u2019re] gonna be able to prototype something, then watch people actually sleeping on it, while our team is at work upstairs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The art is how Casper has prioritized this science while cultivating its playful image. If Wes Anderson made a movie about a mattress company, it would probably look a lot like Casper\u2014and not just because they\u2019ve conducted sleep studies with dogs. It\u2019s also about the way the marketing is built around meme-y blue-and-white cartoons designed to get people\u2014even if they\u2019re years away from needing new bedding\u2014 thinking about the brand. Or the company\u2019s tastefully cheeky nods to the way the mattress, via its springy latex layer, can enhance \u201cindoor sports.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Casper has maintained this puckishness as it moves into physical retail. It\u2019s a dramatic shift for the company, opening it up to more traditional customers who might not feel comfortable making a major purchase online. (A queen-size mattress costs $950.) The company\u2019s showrooms, currently in New York, Los Angeles, and London, feature elements one would never find in a Mattress King, including trompe l\u2019oeil paintings of furniture and secret napping spaces in back. In addition, Casper struck a major partnership with the furniture retailer West Elm, which allows customers to check out the mattresses in person at more than 90 stores across North America. (West Elm, for its part, gets a welcome frisson of Casper\u2019s millennialfriendly vibe.) \u201cWe went full force with Casper,\u201d says Nancy Tsuei, West Elm\u2019s senior VP of merchandising. \u201cWe\u2019ve given them significant real estate in our stores, online marketing, home-page marketing, and space in our catalog, which goes out to millions of homes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parikh won\u2019t say specifically where else he\u2019s trying to bring the Casper sleep experience but allows that it includes pretty much anywhere you might find yourself snoozing: in hotel beds, on cruise ships, on airplanes. \u201cWe\u2019re in the final legs of probably closing some stuff [with an airline],\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you turn a pseudo-average experience of sleeping on a plane into something awesome? Usually that\u2019s going to involve: How do we make the seats better? How do we think about eye masks, duvets, pillows?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What Parikh finds most exciting about Casper going mainstream is that it gives him and his buddies the chance to test their <i>own<\/i> foundational assumptions. \u201cWhen we first started the business, the demographic we thought we were going to hit was millennials,\u201d he says. But hundreds of thousands of customers later, Parikh and company found their beds appealing to a much wider group of users: \u201cI mean, people who are 65 who live in Nebraska also need mattresses,\u201d he says. And if not them, their dogs.<\/p>\n",

Agrawal first grabbed everyone\u2019s attention with a New York subway ad campaign featuring a series of refined, innuendo-filled images of peeled grapefruit and runny eggs. Last September, in lieu of a traditional New York Fashion Week runway show, she staged an event where models in Thinx (including a trans man in the company\u2019s boy shorts) delivered monologues about oppression. As Thinx expands, Agrawal brings the same approach\u2014a mixture of hightech merchandise, considered design, and a rule-breaking philosophy\u2014to new efforts. Last year, she introduced Icon, a brand of incontinence underwear, and Tushy, a bidet attachment, along with seven different styles of Thinx underwear. The additions helped Thinx reach tens of millions of dollars in revenue in 2016. The company is now creating a line of organic, reusable tampons and athletic clothes that incorporate its moisture-wicking technology.<\/p>\n",

The company took the unusual step of working closely with the FDA to design clinical trials\u2014an effort that resulted in a rapid, 104-day approval process for teens and adults to begin using the device this spring. The MiniMed joins a suite of Medtronic initiatives in diabetes care. Last year, the company launched an app that helps patients determine what they can eat based on their levels. A forthcoming Fitbit integration will let researchers aggregate glucose and activity data, to understand the role of exercise in treating diabetes.<\/p>\n",

But rather than trying to buy a piece of the action, she encourages young brands to nurture a culture of giving and to maximize the potential for philanthropic contributions as they scale. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pioneered what he calls an integrated philanthropic model in his company\u2019s early days, giving away equity and goods, and enabling 1.5 million volunteer hours from employees. After evangelizing for others to follow his model, Benioff spun off the initiative three years ago as Pledge 1%. In 2016, the nonprofit added 700 pledges (more than double its 2015 tally, for a total of more than 1,300 companies), including commitments from Harry\u2019s and General Assembly. Australian software juggernaut Atlassian alone has donated more than $6.5 million to education-focused charities. For Lesnick, the growth is a step toward her ultimate goal: irrelevancy. \u201cIn 15 years, we might not even exist,\u201d she says. \u201c[Early-stage philanthropy] will be as common as setting aside equity for future employees.\u201d<\/p>\n",

Here\u2019s how the project is creating a new model for urban revival.<\/p>\n<h3><b>1.

The French Laundry owner has already recruited chefs Costas Spiliadis and Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, and is planning his own steak house. Other spots will be grab-and-go casual. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have 40,000 office workers and 15,000 residents,\u201d says Blau. \u201cWe want places where people can eat every day.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><b>2. A hardworking hotel<\/b><\/h3><p>The developer will use its cult fitness brands to coax residents into its buildings and attract foot traffic from throughout the neighborhood. The site will host a prominent SoulCycle studio and a 60,000- square-foot gym, which will be housed in the company\u2019s first Equinox-branded hotel and spa.<\/p>\n<h3><b>3. A culture hub<\/b><\/h3><p>To create spaces capable of drawing an anticipated 125,000 visitors a day, Related has tapped starchitect Thomas Heatherwick to design <i>Vessel,<\/i> a $200 million, Instagramready sculpture in the site\u2019s plaza. Nearby will be the Shed, a 200,000-squarefoot art space with a retractable roof for indooroutdoor performances and programming.<\/p>\n<h3><b>4.

Once the deal closed, Related signed more affordable brands such as Zara and H&amp;M. \u201cYou have to have a range so people can go for whatever they want,\u201d says Blau.<\/p>\n<h3><b>5. A living landscape<\/b><\/h3><p>A full 50% of the site will remain open, public space. Landscape architecture firm Nelson Byrd Woltz is developing a soil structure deep enough to accommodate full-scale trees\u2014an expensive investment given the site\u2019s position above active rail yards. But it\u2019s reflective of Related\u2019s approach. \u201c[Hudson Yards] gave us the opportunity to think about how you would develop a city from scratch,\u201d says Blau.<\/p>\n",

She learned that the nearly 7 million U.S. women struggling to conceive\u2014 and the doctors counseling them\u2014were still relying on only the most basic information, such as age, to inform decisions on how to start a family. In an era of big data, she thought, these women should be relying on <i>each other<\/i>. Polaris, which broke out of trials in mid-2015, is now being used in more than a dozen of the nation\u2019s largest fertility clinics, which serve some 7% of U.S. fertility patients. It allows specialists to compare a woman\u2019s profile to hundreds of thousands of others and calculate likely outcomes based on comparable patients. From there, her physician can propose a more targeted treatment plan, such as when she might begin IVF, or transition to IVF with donor eggs. To date, Polaris has been used to counsel roughly 30,000 women. After adding 45 employees and doubling in size in 2016, Celmatix is teaming up with home- DNA-testing company 23andMe to develop a noninvasive screening test for potential infertility markers, which is due out later this year. \u201cThe majority of our executives are women of reproductive age,\u201d Beim says. \u201cWe are building products that we intuitively understand.\u201d<\/p>\n",

Ten months later, Horbaczewski launched the Drone Racing League, a series of spectacle-filled competitions in which pilots don VR-like headsets (which provide a drone\u2019s-eye view of the course) and zip their souped-up planes through gnarly, neon-lit obstacle courses. DRL held its first official race at the Miami Dolphins\u2019 Hard Rock Stadium at the end of 2015. By the following fall, it had a major sponsor (Bud Light) and deals with three of the world\u2019s top sports networks\u2014ESPN, Sky Sports in the U.K., and Germany\u2019s ProSieben\u2014to broadcast its inaugural 10-episode, five-race season.
